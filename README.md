# FUTURE_ML_01
Machine Learning Internship Task 1 – Sales/Demand Forecasting
📊 Sales & Demand Forecasting using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

Sales forecasting is an important business process used to predict future sales based on historical data.
In this project, a Machine Learning model is built to analyze past sales trends and forecast future demand.
This helps businesses in better planning, inventory management, and decision-making.

## 🎯 Objective

The main goal of this project is:

To understand historical sales patterns

To build a forecasting model using Machine Learning

To predict future sales values

To visualize sales trends for business interpretation

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

A Linear Regression model is used for forecasting.

Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm that finds a relationship between:

Independent variable: Time (Date)

Dependent variable: Sales

The model learns the trend from past data and uses it to predict future sales values.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

Python – Programming language

Pandas – Data manipulation and analysis

NumPy – Numerical computations

Matplotlib – Data visualization

Scikit-learn – Machine Learning model building

Jupyter Notebook – Interactive development environment

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing

The following preprocessing steps were performed:

Conversion of date column into datetime format

Feature engineering by converting dates into numerical values

Checking dataset structure and data types

These steps ensure that the data is suitable for Machine Learning models.

## 📈 Model Training & Evaluation

The dataset was split into input (X) and output (y) variables

Linear Regression model was trained using historical data

Future sales values were predicted using the trained model

Predicted values were visualized along with actual sales

This helps in understanding the accuracy and trend of predictions.

## 📊 Results & Visualization

A line graph is used to:

Display historical sales data

Show future sales forecasts

The visualization makes it easy for non-technical users to understand sales trends.
