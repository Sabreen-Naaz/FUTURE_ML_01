# Machine Learning Internship Task 1 – Sales/Demand Forecasting

## 📊 Sales & Demand Forecasting using Machine Learning
## 📌 Project Overview

Sales forecasting is an important business process used to predict future sales based on historical data.
In this project, a Machine Learning model is built to analyze past sales trends and forecast future demand.
This helps businesses in better planning, inventory management, and decision-making.

## 🎯 Objective

The main goals of this project are:

To understand historical sales patterns

To build a forecasting model using Machine Learning

To predict future sales values

To visualize sales trends for business interpretation

## 📂 Dataset Used

This project uses the Superstore Sales Dataset obtained from Kaggle.

The dataset contains historical sales records including:

Order Date

Product Category

Region

Sales Amount

Customer Information

These historical records are used to analyze past trends and train the Machine Learning forecasting model.

Dataset Source:
Kaggle – Superstore Sales Dataset (Retail sales data for forecasting and trend analysis)

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

A Linear Regression model is used for forecasting.

Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm that finds a relationship between:

Independent variable: Time (Date)

Dependent variable: Sales

The model learns the trend from past data and uses it to predict future sales values.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

Python – Programming language

Pandas – Data manipulation and analysis

NumPy – Numerical computations

Matplotlib – Data visualization

Scikit-learn – Machine Learning model building

Jupyter Notebook – Interactive development environment

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing

The following preprocessing steps were performed:

Conversion of date column into datetime format

Feature engineering by converting dates into numerical values

Checking dataset structure and data types

Handling missing values (if present)

These steps ensure that the data is suitable for Machine Learning models.

## 📈 Model Training & Evaluation

The dataset was split into input (X) and output (y) variables

Linear Regression model was trained using historical data

Future sales values were predicted using the trained model

Predicted values were visualized along with actual sales

This helps in understanding the accuracy and trend of predictions.

## 📊 Results & Visualization

A line graph is used to:

Display historical sales data

Show future sales forecasts

The visualization makes it easy for non-technical users to understand sales trends and future demand patterns.

## 📌 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Machine Learning can be applied to real-world business problems such as sales forecasting.
The developed model helps businesses make better planning decisions by predicting future sales trends using historical data.
